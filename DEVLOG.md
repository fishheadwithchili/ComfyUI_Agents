# Development Log

## 2024-01-24: Graph Database Integration

### Attempted Approaches
1. Initial Setup
   - Set up JanusGraph with Cassandra for workflow metadata storage
   - Successfully implemented basic data storage and querying

2. Visualization Attempt
   - Tried integrating Neo4j as visualization tool
   - Encountered issues with data type conversion and Windows asyncio
   - Decided to stick with JanusGraph for simplicity and reliability

### Current Status
1. Database Structure
   - Created 4 category vertices: basic, image_editing, keying, instant_id
   - Added 5 workflow vertices with proper relationships
   - All workflows correctly linked to their categories

2. Working Features
   - Successful JanusGraph connection
   - Workflow data import and querying
   - Category-based organization
   - Relationship management

3. Available Tools
   - `test_connection.py`: Tests database connection and queries data
   - `import_workflow.py`: Imports new workflows into database
   - `example_usage.py`: Database operation examples

### Next Steps
1. Implement workflow export to JSON functionality
2. Implement workflow comparison functionality
3. Add support for workflow versioning
4. Develop workflow migration tools
5. Consider adding workflow optimization suggestions

## 2024-01-25: Workflow Validation System

### Implemented Features
1. Node-Socket Relationship Validation
   - Implemented validation for node and socket relationships
   - Added checks for input/output interface completeness
   - Verified socket type consistency

2. Node Connection Validation
   - Added validation for node-to-node connections (links)
   - Implemented data type checking for connected interfaces
   - Added detailed connection information logging

3. Query System Enhancement
   - Developed comprehensive node query functionality
   - Added support for querying by node ID and type
   - Implemented detailed connection information display

### Current Status
1. Validation System
   - Complete workflow structure validation
   - Interface type checking
   - Connection integrity verification
   - Detailed error reporting

2. Working Tools
   - `workflow_validator.py`: Validates workflow structure and connections
   - `workflow_query.py`: Advanced node and connection querying
   - `database_manager.py`: Enhanced database management

3. Validation Capabilities
   - Node property validation
   - Interface completeness checking
   - Connection type verification
   - Detailed error reporting and statistics

### Next Steps
1. Implement workflow comparison functionality
2. Add support for workflow versioning
3. Develop workflow migration tools
4. Consider adding workflow optimization suggestions
