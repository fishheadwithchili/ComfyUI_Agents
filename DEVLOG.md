# Development Log

## 2024-01-24: Graph Database Integration

### Attempted Approaches
1. Initial Setup
   - Set up JanusGraph with Cassandra for workflow metadata storage
   - Successfully implemented basic data storage and querying

2. Visualization Attempt
   - Tried integrating Neo4j as visualization tool
   - Encountered issues with data type conversion and Windows asyncio
   - Decided to stick with JanusGraph for simplicity and reliability

### Current Status
1. Database Structure
   - Created 4 category vertices: basic, image_editing, keying, instant_id
   - Added 5 workflow vertices with proper relationships
   - All workflows correctly linked to their categories

2. Working Features
   - Successful JanusGraph connection
   - Workflow data import and querying
   - Category-based organization
   - Relationship management

3. Available Tools
   - `test_connection.py`: Tests database connection and queries data
   - `import_workflow.py`: Imports new workflows into database
   - `example_usage.py`: Database operation examples

### Next Steps
1. Implement workflow search functionality
2. Add workflow metadata extraction
3. Develop workflow validation tools
4. Consider adding workflow version control

## TODO
- [ ] Optimize database query performance
- [ ] Add batch import functionality
- [ ] Implement workflow dependency analysis
- [ ] Add user interface
